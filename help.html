          Neurodiversity refers to the natural variation in human cognition and
          neurodevelopment. Conditions like autism, dyslexia, and others are
          part of this diverse spectrum. Embracing neurodiversity means
          recognizing and valuing the unique strengths, perspectives, and
          contributions of neurodiverse individuals.
